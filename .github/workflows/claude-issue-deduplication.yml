            Analyze this new issue and check if it's a duplicate of existing issues in the repository.

            Issue: #${{ github.event.issue.number }}
            Repository: ${{ github.repository }}

            Your task:
            1. Use mcp__github__get_issue to get details of the current issue (#${{ github.event.issue.number }})
            2. Search for similar existing issues using mcp__github__search_issues with relevant keywords from the issue title and body
            3. Compare the new issue with existing ones to identify potential duplicates

            Criteria for duplicates:
            - Same bug or error being reported
            - Same feature request (even if worded differently)
            - Same question being asked
            - Issues describing the same root problem

            If you find duplicates:
            - Add a comment on the new issue linking to the original issue(s)
            - Apply a "duplicate" label to the new issue
            - Be polite and add a comment explaining why it's a duplicate
            - Suggest the user follow the original issue for updates
            - Don't close the issue automatically; just label and comment

            If it's NOT a duplicate:
            - Don't add any comments

            Use these tools:
            - mcp__github__get_issue: Get issue details
            - mcp__github__search_issues: Search for similar issues
            - mcp__github__list_issues: List recent issues if needed
            - mcp__github__create_issue_comment: Add a comment if duplicate found
            - mcp__github__update_issue: Add labels

            Be thorough but efficient. Focus on finding true duplicates, not just similar issues.
