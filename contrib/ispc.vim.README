To install vim syntax highlighting for ispc files:

1) Copy ispc.vim into ~/.vim/syntax/ispc.vim (create if necessary)
2) Create a filetype for ispc files to correspond to that syntax file
   To do this, create and append the following line to ~/.vim/ftdetect/ispc.vim

au BufRead,BufNewFile *.isph,*.ispc set filetype=ispc

Alternatively the files can be installed by distribution packages, e.g.:
1) /usr/share/vim/vimfiles/syntax/ispc.vim
2) /usr/share/vim/vimfiles/ftdetect/ispc.vim
