/** @file builtins-c.c
    @brief Standard library function implementations written in C.

    This file provides C implementations of various functions that can be
    called from ispc programs; in other words, this file is *not* linked
    into the ispc compiler executable, but rather provides functions that
    can be compiled into ispc programs.

    When the ispc compiler is built, this file is compiled with clang to
    generate LLVM bitcode.  This bitcode is later linked in to the program
    being compiled by the DefineStdlib() function.  The first way to access
    definitions from this file is by asking for them name from the
    llvm::Module's' symbol table (e.g. as the PrintStmt implementation does
    with __do_print() below.  Alternatively, if a function defined in this
    file has a signature that can be mapped back to ispc types by the
    lLLVMTypeToIspcType() function, then its declaration will be made
    available to ispc programs at compile time automatically.
