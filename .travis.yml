# "minimal" instead of "cpp", because of https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/8363
# Otherwise during python invocation PATH is prepended by /usr/bin and it yields wrong llvm-as.
language: minimal

    - docker

# Some magic is here. Docker is used to load pre-built LLVM as part of custom built image.
# Custom built LLVM is required because
#   (1) we need a patched version of LLVM for some of LLVM versions for performance and
#       stability reasons,
#   (2) it must be a dump-enabled LLVM build (release version without assertions and without
#       stripping off dump() function), this affects LLVM 5.0 and later versions,
#   (3) same compiler needs to be used for building LLVM and ISPC, otherwise there might be
#       ABI incompatibilities causing link errors and runtime segfaults,
#   (4) to have flexibility of testing with a range of LLVM versions that we need.
