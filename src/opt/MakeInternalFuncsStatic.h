/** There are a number of target-specific functions that we use during
    these optimization passes.  By the time we are done with optimization,
    any uses of these should be inlined and no calls to these functions
    should remain.  This pass marks all of these functions as having
    private linkage so that subsequent passes can eliminate them as dead
    code, thus cleaning up the final code output by the compiler.  We can't
    just declare these as static from the start, however, since then they
    end up being eliminated as dead code during early optimization passes
    even though we may need to generate calls to them during later
    optimization passes.
