/** @file decl.h
    @brief Declarations related to type declarations; the parser basically
    creates instances of these classes, which are then turned into actual
    Types.

    Three classes work together to represent declarations.  As an example,
    consider a declaration like:

    static uniform int foo, bar[10];

    An instance of the Declaration class represents this entire declaration
    of two variables, 'foo' and 'bar'.  It holds a single instance of the
    DeclSpecs class represents the common specifiers for all of the
    variables--here, that the declaration has the 'static' and 'uniform'
    qualifiers, and that it's basic type is 'int'.  Then for each variable
    declaration, the Declaraiton class holds an instance of a Declarator,
    which in turn records the per-variable information like the name, array
    size (if any), initializer expression, etc.
