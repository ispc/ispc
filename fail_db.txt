% The list is unordered and contains information about commonly used platforms / configurations.
% Our goal is to maintain this list for Linux, macOS and Windows with reasonably new compilers.
% Note, that it's important which C++ compiler was used.
% Please also note that it's very important to have correctly built LLVM. There are a number of
% LLVM bugs in released versions, that we have to workaround by applying patches (see llvm_patches
% folder). The recommended way to build LLVM on Unix is to use "alloy.py".
