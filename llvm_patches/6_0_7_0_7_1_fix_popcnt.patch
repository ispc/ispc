# Original LLVM commit details :
# Revision = r353124, Fix details = https://reviews.llvm.org/D57616
# This patch is to fix popcnt-1.ispc tests for llvm 6.0 onwards.
# Without this patch, the machine scheduler incorrectly calculates
# dependencies between this load and other accesses.  In this case,
# there was a 32 byte vector store that was split into two 16 byte
# stores, one with offset 0 and one with offset 16. The size of the
# memory operand for both was 16. The scheduler correctly detected
# the alias with the offset 0 store, but not the offset 16 store.
