=== v1.0.3 === (not yet released)

ispc now has a bulit-in pre-processor (from LLVM's clang compiler).
(Thanks to Pete Couperus!)  It is therefore no longer necessary to use
cl.exe for preprocessing before on Windows; the MSVC proejct files for the
examples have been updated accordingly.

There is another variant of the shuffle() function int the standard
library: "<type> shuffle(<type> v0, <type> v1, int permute)", where the
permutation vector indexes over the concatenation of the two vectors
(e.g. the value 0 corresponds to the first element of v0, the value
2*programCount-1 corresponds to the last element of v1, etc.)

There are now both 'signed' and 'unsigned' variants of the standard library
functions like packed_load_active() that that references to arrays of
signed int32s and unsigned int32s respectively.  (The
{load_from,store_to}_{int8,int16}() functions have similarly been augmented
to have both 'signed' and 'unsigned' variants.)

In initializer expressions with variable declarations, it is no longer
legal to initialize arrays and structs with single scalar values that then
initialize their members; they now must be initialized with initializer
lists in braces (or initialized after of the initializer with a loop over
array elements, etc.)

=== v1.0.2 === (1 July 2011)

Floating-point hexidecimal constants are now parsed correctly on Windows
(fixes issue #16).

SSE2 is now the default target if --cpu=atom is given in the command line
arguments and another target isn't explicitly specified.

The standard library now provides broadcast(), rotate(), and shuffle()
routines for efficient communication between program instances.

The MSVC solution files to build the examples on Windows now use
/fpmath:fast when building.

=== v1.0.1 === (24 June 2011)

ispc no longer requires that pointers to memory that are passed in to ispc
have alignment equal to the targets vector width; now alignment just has to
be the regular element alignment (e.g. 4 bytes for floats, etc.)  This
change also fixed a number of cases where it previously incorrectly
generated aligned load/store instructions in cases where the address wasn't
actually aligned (even if the base address passed into ispc code was).
