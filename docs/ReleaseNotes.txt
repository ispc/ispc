=== v1.0.1 === (24 June 2011)

ispc no longer requires that pointers to memory that are passed in to ispc
have alignment equal to the targets vector width; now alignment just has to
be the regular element alignment (e.g. 4 bytes for floats, etc.)  This
change also fixed a number of cases where it previously incorrectly
generated aligned load/store instructions in cases where the address wasn't
actually aligned (even if the base address passed into ispc code was).
