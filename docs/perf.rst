The SPMD programming model that ``ispc`` makes it easy to harness the
computational power available in SIMD vector units on modern CPUs, while
its basis in C makes it easy for programmers to adopt and use
productively.  This page summarizes the performance of ``ispc`` with the
workloads in the ``examples/`` directory of the ``ispc`` distribution.

These results were measured on a 4-core Apple iMac with a 4-core 3.4GHz
Intel速 Core-i7 processor using the Intel速 AVX instruction set.  The basis
for comparison is a reference C++ implementation compiled with gcc 4.2.1,
the version distributed with OS X 10.7.2.  (The reference implementation is
also included in the ``examples/`` directory.)

The following table shows speedups for a number of the examples on a
2.40GHz, 40-core Intel速 Xeon E7-8870 system with the Intel速 SSE4
instruction set, running Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Enterprise.  Here,
the serial C/C++ baseline code was compiled with MSVC 2010.
